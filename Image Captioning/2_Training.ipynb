    "### Task #1\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin by setting the following variables:\n",
    "- `batch_size` - the batch size of each training batch.  It is the number of image-caption pairs used to amend the model weights in each training step. \n",
    "- `vocab_threshold` - the minimum word count threshold.  Note that a larger threshold will result in a smaller vocabulary, whereas a smaller threshold will include rarer words and result in a larger vocabulary.  \n",
    "- `vocab_from_file` - a Boolean that decides whether to load the vocabulary from file. \n",
    "- `embed_size` - the dimensionality of the image and word embeddings.  \n",
    "- `hidden_size` - the number of features in the hidden state of the RNN decoder.  \n",
    "- `num_epochs` - the number of epochs to train the model.  We recommend that you set `num_epochs=3`, but feel free to increase or decrease this number as you wish.  [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) trained a captioning model on a single state-of-the-art GPU for 3 days, but you'll soon see that you can get reasonable results in a matter of a few hours!  (_But of course, if you want your model to compete with current research, you will have to train for much longer._)\n",
    "- `save_every` - determines how often to save the model weights.  We recommend that you set `save_every=1`, to save the model weights after each epoch.  This way, after the `i`th epoch, the encoder and decoder weights will be saved in the `models/` folder as `encoder-i.pkl` and `decoder-i.pkl`, respectively.\n",
    "- `print_every` - determines how often to print the batch loss to the Jupyter notebook while training.  Note that you **will not** observe a monotonic decrease in the loss function while training - this is perfectly fine and completely expected!  You are encouraged to keep this at its default value of `100` to avoid clogging the notebook, but feel free to change it.\n",
    "- `log_file` - the name of the text file containing - for every step - how the loss and perplexity evolved during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're not sure where to begin to set some of the values above, you can peruse [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) and [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) for useful guidance!  **To avoid spending too long on this notebook**, you are encouraged to consult these suggested research papers to obtain a strong initial guess for which hyperparameters are likely to work best.  Then, train a single model, and proceed to the next notebook (**3_Inference.ipynb**).  If you are unhappy with your performance, you can return to this notebook to tweak the hyperparameters (and/or the architecture in **model.py**) and re-train your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** Describe your CNN-RNN architecture in detail.  With this architecture in mind, how did you select the values of the variables in Task 1?  If you consulted a research paper detailing a successful implementation of an image captioning model, please provide the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**  About CNN-RNN Architecture : I have used a ResNet pre-trained model for the encoder. ResNet stands for Residual Networks. More specifically, I have used resnet-50 which is a 50 layer residual network. In order to get more glimpse about the ResNet architecture, follow this paper : https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf . It has been proved that training residual networks is easier than training  a simple deep convolutional neural networks and also the problem of degrading accuracy is resolved in case of ResNets.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CNN encoder has been implemented with the final fully-connected layer removed to extract features from a batch of pre-processed images. The output is then flattened to a vector, before being passed through a Linear layer to transform the feature vector to have the same size as the word embedding. \n",
    "\n",
    "For Decoder, I have followed the Show and Tell Model described in this paper (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf). The structure includes a single LSTM  (Long Short Term Memory ) layer followed by a fully-connected (linear) layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tweaking of Hyperparameters: I have used a batch size of 25 which is enough to reduce the variance of the stochastic gradients. This, in turn, allows to take bigger step-sizes, which means the optimization algorithm makes progress faster. I have used a vocab_threshold value of 5. We need this parameter to be set for building the vocabulary file. With this value of voccab_threshold, vocabulary of 8855 tokens has been built. Also, I have used embed_size = 512 and hidden_size = 512.\n",
    "\n",
    "### (Optional) Task #2\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have provided a recommended image transform `transform_train` for pre-processing the training images, but you are welcome (and encouraged!) to modify it as you wish.  When modifying this transform, keep in mind that:\n",
    "- the images in the dataset have varying heights and widths, and \n",
    "- if using a pre-trained model, you must perform the corresponding appropriate normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the transform in `transform_train`?  If you left the transform at its provided value, why do you think that it is a good choice for your CNN architecture?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** For the pre-trained CNN Encoder, we need a tensor of shape (224x224x3). So, in order to achieve this , I have transformed the image. I have first resized the original image to 256 and then getting it cropped to the size 224x224 from any random location. After that I have flipped the image horizontally with the probability of 0.5 and then finally converted the PIL image to a tensor and getting it normalized for a pre-trained CNN encoder. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #3\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will specify a Python list containing the learnable parameters of the model.  For instance, if you decide to make all weights in the decoder trainable, but only want to train the weights in the embedding layer of the encoder, then you should set `params` to something like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "params = list(decoder.parameters()) + list(encoder.embed.parameters()) \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the trainable parameters of your architecture?  Why do you think this is a good choice?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** I have used the following trainable parameters for decoder and encoder respectively. { params = list(decoder.parameters()) + list(encoder.embed.parameters()) }. Since, the decoder is being trained from scratch so we need to train all the parameters . Hence, for decoder, I have taken all the learnable parameters (decoder.parameters()) . And, since we are using a pre-trained model for encoder, hence there is no need to take into account all the parameters. However, I do need the parameters of embedding layer to be trained. Hence, for encoder, I have used (encoder.embed.parameters()).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task #4\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you will select an [optimizer](http://pytorch.org/docs/master/optim.html#torch.optim.Optimizer).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question:** How did you select the optimizer used to train your model?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** Since Adam maintains an adaptive learning rate and momentum for each parameter so, I used Adam Optimizer with the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "    learning rate: 0.001\n",
    "    betas: (0.9, 0.999) -> used for computing running averages of gradient and its square\n",
    "    eps: (1e-8) -> to improve numerical stablility\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, it follows per-parameter learning rate methods, which helps in tuning hyperparameters for the learning rate schedule without requiring expensive work. It is faster and outeperforms other techniques."

For now, we strongly encourage you to train your model for the suggested 3 epochs without worrying about performance; then, you should immediately transition to the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**) to see how your model performs on the test data.  If your model needs to be changed, you can come back to this notebook, amend hyperparameters (if necessary), and re-train the model.\n",

In the next (optional) step of this notebook, we provide some guidance for assessing the performance on the validation dataset."

    "To assess potential overfitting, one approach is to assess performance on a validation set.  If you decide to do this **optional** task, you are required to first complete all of the steps in the next notebook in the sequence (**3_Inference.ipynb**); as part of that notebook, you will write and test code (specifically, the `sample` method in the `DecoderRNN` class) that uses your RNN decoder to generate captions.  That code will prove incredibly useful here. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you decide to validate your model, please do not edit the data loader in **data_loader.py**.  Instead, create a new file named **data_loader_val.py** containing the code for obtaining the data loader for the validation data.  You can access:\n",
    "- the validation images at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/images/train2014/'`, and\n",
    "- the validation image caption annotation file at filepath `'/opt/cocoapi/annotations/captions_val2014.json'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The suggested approach to validating your model involves creating a json file such as [this one](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi/blob/master/results/captions_val2014_fakecap_results.json) containing your model's predicted captions for the validation images.  Then, you can write your own script or use one that you [find online](https://github.com/tylin/coco-caption) to calculate the BLEU score of your model.  You can read more about the BLEU score, along with other evaluation metrics (such as TEOR and Cider) in section 4.1 of [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf).  For more information about how to use the annotation file, check out the [website](http://cocodataset.org/#download) for the COCO dataset."
