# Computer-Vision-Nanodegree-Udacity

## Projects covered under the Udacity's Computer Vision Nanodegree Curriculum:


<b> 1. Facial KeyPoints Detection:  </b> <p> In this project, knowledge of computer vision techniques and deep learning architectures are applied to build a facial keypoint detection system that takes in any image with faces, and predicts the location of 68 distinguishing keypoints on each face!

Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face and are used in many applications. These applications include: facial tracking, facial pose recognition, facial filters, and emotion recognition. The implemented code looks at any image, detects faces, and predicts the locations of facial keypoints on each face. </p>

<b> 2. Image Captioning </b>
