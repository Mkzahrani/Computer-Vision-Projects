# Computer-Vision-Nanodegree-Udacity

## Projects covered under the Udacity's Computer Vision Nanodegree Curriculum:


<b> 1. Facial KeyPoints Detection:  </b> <p> In this project, knowledge of computer vision techniques and deep learning architectures are applied to build a facial keypoint detection system that takes in any image with faces, and predicts the location of 68 distinguishing keypoints on each face!</p>

<p>Facial keypoints include points around the eyes, nose, and mouth on a face and are used in many applications. These applications include: facial tracking, facial pose recognition, facial filters, and emotion recognition. The implemented code looks at any image, detects faces, and predicts the locations of facial keypoints on each face. </p>

<b> 2. Image Captioning :</b> <p>In this project,  a neural network architecture (CNN Encoder- RNN Decoder) is constructed which generates captions from images (text describing the image) automatically.  </p>
  
The model is trained on Microsoft Common Objects in Context (MS COCO) dataset and the network is tested on the novel images.</p>
